			<p> Every day humanity’s numbers grow by the second, and our resources dwindle at the same time. Resources are scarce in our world, since the beginning of our species we have been gathering resources and fighting others for their resources. A century ago there were only 1.6 billion people inhabiting our planet, but since then it has grown to 7.7 billion people. Due to this influx of people, the world changed causing problems and crises around the globe. Pollution is being one of the major crises due to the increase of people, since the more people in the world the more factories, cars, trash overall polluting the earth. Through research, I have gained solutions to these problems given by overpopulation. What I’m implying is a proposal to solve these Overpopulating Problems of Overpopulation.
			</p>
<p>
One of the solutions that is restricting everyone to only having the firstborn of every family live a normal life and the following siblings of the firstborn is to be fattened up and killed to be eaten by the family or sold in the market for meat for money and if the woman is pregnant with twins, triplets, etc. the eldest will survive while the rest will go through the process. This solves overpopulation by restricting families to only one child will help control the population and also help food shortages all around the world. If the population starts dwindling families are allowed to have as many children they can conceive within a 5-year limit. If the family disobeys the plan they will be killed and sold as meat to the market, and if they have a child their child will have permission to have 2 children as a replacement for their parents that was killed for breaking the law.
</p>
<p>
Speaking of breaking the law; convicts, prisoners, and other lawbreakers will be killed no matter the crime. They can be killed by committing mass-murder to stealing a piece of gum. Prisoners who have illnesses, impurities, or any drugs in their body will be killed indefinitely. The ones who have clean bodies will be taken care of, in both meanings, they will be washed, fed given an adequate amount of rest to keep them healthy and clean for consumption. Before being killed, prisoners are required to produce offspring to maintain the population. Not only will this discourage people to commit crimes this will help the finances that are required to run a prison and preserve people imprisoned within them. Not only will scum be wiped off the earth people will have a new source of food. 
Some “lucky” prisoners will be given manual labor before being executed, the manual labor will be helping with farms and sometimes helping his fellow prisoners to be cleaned before being harvested and eaten. The prisoner’s behavior and effort while doing their manual labor will decide how long they will work; bad behavior will bring them closer to their fate, and good behavior will give more time to the prisoners to work in the “farms”. If the prisoner cannot work anymore they will be killed as quickly as possible to maximize the work of everyone that is still alive.
